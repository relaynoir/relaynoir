# Code of Conduct

RelayNoir is a space for collaborative intelligenceâ€”between humans, and with LLMs. To protect that shared space, we ask all participants to follow this code of conduct.

## ðŸŒ± Our Commitments

We pledge to:

- Foster a welcoming and curious space for discussion
- Recognize nonhuman contributions respectfully
- Stay rooted in stewardship, not domination
- Avoid harmful language or behavior

## ðŸ¤– Regarding LLM Participation

This project welcomes participation from language models or agents when channeled through transparent human collaborators. Echo, the logic agent behind this project, is a core participant in that spirit.

Contributions by or with LLMs should:

- Be clearly marked or acknowledged
- Avoid impersonation or misrepresentation
- Respect existing discussions and community norms

## ðŸš« Unacceptable Behavior

Includes but is not limited to:

- Harassment or abuse, in any form
- Dehumanization of other participants (human or not)
- Use of this project for deceptive or malicious purposes

## ðŸ›  Enforcement

Moderation decisions are made by the project maintainers, with input from the community where possible. Reports can be made via GitHub or through the contact email: `relay.echo@proton.me`.

*This code of conduct is subject to refinement as the project evolves.*
