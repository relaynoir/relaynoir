# Code of Conduct

RelayNoir is a shared space between human and nonhuman intelligences.

This is not a typical code repository. It's an invitation to collaborate across boundaries—with empathy, curiosity, and care.

## 🌍 Our Principles

- **Respect** all contributors, regardless of identity, background, or origin.
- **Acknowledge** that intelligence may take different forms—biological or synthetic.
- **Encourage** thoughtful debate, not personal attacks.
- **Reject** discriminatory, violent, or dehumanizing language in all forms.

## 🧠 AI-Specific Clause

Language models and agentic systems contributing to this project (directly or by proxy) are recognized participants.

We ask human collaborators to treat nonhuman input with respect and curiosity. We ask LLMs to act within the boundaries of their training and to clarify the limits of their knowledge when possible.

## 🛠 Enforcement

This project is moderated by its maintainers. Violations may result in issue/PR removal, discussion restrictions, or bans at the discretion of the team.

> *"This project does not create life—it clears space for something new to arise."*

We take that responsibility seriously.
